                      At the core of all Anenta services is our simple to use online waste management platform. This platform allows you to view and manage your siteâ€™s services. You can view your specifications, including the number and types of bins, frequency of collections and a calendar showing deliveries and collections. You can view and report service issues, including missed collections, rescheduling and ad-hoc collections request or the delivery of consumables.

                    <h5>Notifications</h5>
                    <p>
                      We will proactively send notifications of any changes which may impact service delivery. For example, if a collection will be missed we will notify anyone affected giving the reason it was missed and when it will be completed performed.

                    <p>
                      Anenta's waste platform knows when and what you should have collected as well as any service failures that may occur. We use this information to validate the accuracy of any invoice issued to you, ensuring you are only paying for the service that you requested. We spot and validate where additional collections are made or where more waste was collected than was requested.
