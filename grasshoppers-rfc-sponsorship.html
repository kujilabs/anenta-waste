				<p><strong>We are proud to announce our very first sports sponsorship deal, with Grasshoppers RFC.  </strong></p>

				<p><strong>This has been achieved through the hard work of our team to maintain the highest service standards for our customers.  Not only are Anenta the main club sponsor, but we have also implemented a new waste management contract for the club. This will see savings of over 25% every year, money that can be pushed back into running this fantastic rugby club.</strong></p>
			 
				<p>Grasshoppers RFC are currently playing in ‘London 3 North West’, they are a family orientated club dedicated to the progression of playing abilities from a very young age to senior level. Gary Cunningham, Chairman at Grasshoppers said: "We are really pleased to be associated with a company such as Anenta. This sponsorship will help towards the running of the club, in particular supporting the good work done by our volunteers working with our younger boys and girls. We are really grateful to Anenta!"</p>

				<p>Matt Gilmore, Director of Rugby said: "We are responsible for over 300 players from age five upwards and sponsorship can cover anything from team kit to pitch maintenance, equipment, first-aid support and physiotherapy. On-going support from the local business community is vital to the club, and we are immensely grateful to Graham and Anenta. This support enables us to invest in the future of this much-loved sporting facility for the benefit of its members and the local community."</p>

				<p>Graham Flynn, Director at Anenta and our resident Grasshoppers Fanboy is very enthusiastic, not only about the deal, but about Grasshoppers: "We are delighted to be able to sponsor a local club which is regularly enjoyed by hundreds of people. This is a great opportunity for us to demonstrate our company's commitment to support the local community. Partnerships with companies like us are imperative to the continued success of every rugby club in the country, and Grasshoppers is no different. We are looking forward to seeing all Grasshopper teams continue their successful start to the season in their new shirts.”</p>
