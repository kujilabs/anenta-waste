<p>Millions of pounds of tax payers money could be saved if more efficient waste management
practices were adopted in the public and private sector, the majority of savings coming from the
NHS.</p>

<p>Anenta’s analysis of waste management contracts across the NHS has highlighted a serious
disconnect between those responsible for procuring waste management contracts and their
understanding of the NHS’s waste management requirements.</p>

<p>Contracts are therefore incorrectly specified from the start and the result is that many Trusts are
paying for waste management services which are either not fit for purpose financially, or do not
deliver the specific requirements including innovative efficiencies, adding further strain to an already
stressed system.</p>

<p>Correct specification of waste management contracts equates to improved operational efficiency
and is a real alternative to cuts which impact directly upon front line services.</p>

<p>The limitations of the NHS procurement framework itself presents another issue. The provision of
high value services where contracts are greater in value than £118,133pa, are subject to a Supply,
Services and Design Contract standard framework. This framework works against the very thing it is
designed to secure – best value for the Trust.</p>

<p>Typically the public sector issue standard and out-dated specifications resulting in recycled tender
responses being returned. These out-dated responses therefore do not take into account any new
industry efficiencies as they do not form part of the specification.</p>

<p>Meanwhile bidders are always cautious of being innovative within their bids as there could be the
possibility that the evaluation teams could score them negatively for not directly responding to the
requirements within the specification.</p>

<p>In effect it means there is a catch 22 situation where the bidder feels they meet the specification
could go beyond, demonstrating real innovation, but are unwilling to risk losing the opportunity by
thinking outside the box.</p>

<p>Compounding the issue is the fact that once the service has been procured, it is often not managed
effectively and in significant number of cases, it is not managed at all by the customer.</p>

<p>Many Trusts rely upon contractors to self-manage and indeed, for some, there is no viable
alternative. A lack of waste contract management expertise combined with a lack of ownership
within the NHS means that in many instances it falls to inexperienced staff, to handle waste
management contracts – something which they have neither the time nor appropriate expertise to
do.</p>

<p>To help tackle these challenges and enable the NHS realise the benefits and savings that are
possible, Anenta has already invested more than £1m developing its proprietary online waste
management platform.</p>

<p>Key to the success of this new system, is the empowerment of all stakeholders, an integral
component of Anenta’s vision – creating and maintaining trust between the customer and service
provider, underpinned by a correctly specified service.</p>

<p>In four years, this new way of working has enabled Anenta to save the NHS over £3.2m on existing
contracts across 19 CCGs. When extrapolated across England, potential savings of £8.75m annually
become apparent. Procurement of new contracts will see this figure increase dramatically by
implementing contract control and accountability through the use of Anenta’s management
platform and expertise.</p>
