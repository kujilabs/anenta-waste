<p>Following the successful implementation of pharmacy services across South East England, Anenta has now been successful in expanding its service to GPs on behalf of the region’s CCGs.</p>

<p>Since being awarded the contract, Anenta has analysed usage data across all locations and identified over £1m of waste within the system. </p>

<p>All new CCG contracts for Anenta’s end-to-end waste management service run from 1 April, covering 559 locations across 17 CCGs in Surrey, Sussex and Kent. The service encompasses operational management, data validations and invoice approval, compliance auditing and setting sustainable efficiency drives which will meet economic and environmental targets within the NHS as a whole.</p>

<p>Anenta’s Managing Director Graham Flynn commented: “This is about using Anenta’s online waste management platform, Vector, to facilitate a partnership relationship between the GPs and Pharmacies, NHS, and CCGs and the waste contractors, that brings with it as near total transparency as possible. We can, between us, achieve greater efficiencies, compliance and sustainability - so long as nothing is hidden and that producers and disposal companies play by the rules.</p>

<p>“The aim is to liberate teams in GPs and pharmacies to spend more time on clinical care and worry less about how to dispose of their waste sustainably and cost-effectively. CCGs benefit from standardisation in communications, training packages and auditing to make sure they are all compliant, and the economies of scale under which services are delivered and efficiency measures deployed.</p>

<p>“Anenta is also taking on the management of the waste contracts that have been centrally procured. We know that these contacts are not necessarily as efficient as they could be, so we are making them super-efficient within the remit given to us.”</p>
