  <li><strong>Records relevant for tax and customs authorities</strong> - retained for 8 years from the end of the year to which the records relate</li>

  <li><strong>Personal data held on marketing or business development records</strong> - retained 3 years from the last date on which a data subject has interacted with us</li>
</ul>

<p>For any category of personal data not specifically defined in this notice, and unless otherwise specified by applicable law, the required retention period for any personal data will be deemed to be 7 years from the date of receipt by us of that data.</p>
<p>The retention periods stated in this notice can be prolonged or shortened as may be required (for example, in the event that legal proceedings apply to the data or if there is an on-going investigation into the data).</p>
<p>We review the personal data (and the categories of personal data) we are holding on a regular basis to ensure the data we are holding is still relevant to our business and is accurate. If we discover that certain data we are holding is no longer necessary or accurate, we will take reasonable steps to correct or delete this data as may be required.</p>
<p>If you wish to request that data we hold about you is amended or deleted, please refer to the "Your rights" section below, which explains your privacy rights.</p>

<h4>Who has access to your personal data?</h4>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, we do not and never shall sell your personal data to third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.</p>
<p>We work closely with a number of third parties (including business parties, service providers and fraud protection services) and we may receive information from them about you. These third parties may collect information about you including, but not limited to, your IP address, device-specific information, server logs, device event information, location information, and unique application numbers. We use their features within our website, however, in some instances, they may be acting as data controller and they will have their own privacy policies, which we advise you to read.</p>
<p>We may pass your personal data to third parties for the provision of services on our behalf (for example processing your payment or to vendors collecting or dealing with waste). However, we will only ever share information about you that is necessary to provide the service and we have specific contracts in place, which ensure your personal data is secure and will not be used for any marketing purposes.</p>
<p>We may share your information if a third party acquires us and therefore your data will be deemed an asset of the business. In these circumstances, we may disclose your personal data to the prospective buyer of our business, subject to both parties entering into appropriate confidentiality undertakings.</p>
<p>Similarly, we may share your personal data if we are under a duty to disclose data in order to comply with any legal obligation or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Anenta, our customers, or others. This includes but is not limited to exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection, credit risk reduction and dispute policies. However, we will take steps with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected.</p>

<p>You can request that we no longer process your personal data in certain ways, whilst not requiring us to delete the same data. However, some of our Services will not be available if processing is restricted.</p>

<p>You have the right to ask us to delete, or remove your personal data. This is known as your right to be forgotten.</p>
<p>In preventing the use or processing of your personal data, it may delay or prevent us from fulfilling our contractual obligations to you. It may also mean that we shall be unable to provide our services or process the cancellation of your service.</p>
<p>You can view, edit or delete your personal data through Anentaâ€™s control panel. You can also make choices about Anentaâ€™s collection of your data and how we use it.</p>

<p>If you are a private individual, we will not contact you for marketing purposes unless you have given us your consent. You can opt out of receiving further marketing communications or other communications from us at any time and can change your marketing preferences at any time within your Anenta Ltd control panel.</p>
<p>You have right to receive copies of personal data we hold about you in a commonly used and easily storable format (please let us know a format which suits you). You may also request that we transfer your personal data directly to third party (where technically possible).</p>
<p>If we are relying on your consent as the basis on which we are processing your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Even if you have not expressly given your consent to our processing, you also have the right to object (see above).</p>
