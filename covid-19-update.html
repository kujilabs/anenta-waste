    <h1>COVID-19 – CUSTOMER ADVICE</h1>

    <br><br>

    <p>As the UK Government continues to implement its management plan for Covid-19, we understand that there is a need to provide guidance on the management of clinical waste arising from any treatment or deep clean/decontamination - as instructed by Public Health England.</p>
    <p>We also want to let you know that our contingency plans enable us to continue to provide you with the same level of service as you can expect at any other time of the year seeing no interruption to our activity.</p>
    <p>Anenta has over 10 years’ experience working in the clinical waste industry for both public and private sector organisations.  Our specialised approach utilising technology and expert knowledge of the industry places us in the ideal position to offer advice and support to our clients on the disposal of contaminated waste.</p>
    <p>There are multiple clinical waste disposal contractors involved in the management of clinical waste, each instilling their own protocols to ensure the safety of their employees. Please read on for guidance to assist in the management of the waste.</p>


    <h3>GENERAL GUIDANCE</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Public Health England has issued Covid-19: infection prevention and control guidance which provides a great level of detail on the management of this virus. You can read this here. </li>
      <li>Waste from a suspected or a confirmed case must be disposed of as Category B waste. The transport of Category B waste is described in Health Technical Memorandum 07-01: Safe management of healthcare waste. You can read this here. </li>
      <li>As the Covid-19 virus is confirmed to be a Category B infection the waste containment currently provided to you is suitable for the management/packaging of this waste (UN3291 18 01 03). To ensure effective management the current processes and protocols for sealing bags and sharps containers must be fully adhered to including labelling.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We are here to help you manage the disposal of the associated clinical waste with the designated collection and disposal contractor. Do not contact the collection and disposal contractor directly.</p>
    <p>You can contact Anenta Ltd by calling 03301 222 143 or simply open a service ticket by accessing your online account should you have other waste related issues. Access your online account here.</p>
    <p>If you or a colleague believe you may have symptoms, or have been exposed to the virus, please complete the Public Health England Questionnaire which will give you further advice on what to do.</p>



    <h3>WITH THE WASTE</h3>
    <p>In the event that there is a suspected case of Covid-19, any waste arising from the assessment of the individual should be dealt with as Category B infectious waste (orange bag). </p>

    <p>We ask that you:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Double bag this waste i.e. seal the bag in the standard fashion with a swan neck and make use of a cable tie to seal the bag. </li>
      <li>Place this bag into a clean orange bag and seal again as advised above. </li>
    </ol>

    <p>There is no need to quarantine the waste from other Category B infectious waste.</p>

    <h3>Precautionary cleaning</h3>

    <p>In the event of a suspected case and the tests are returned as negative, you may have decided to do a precautionary clean in the areas affected. The waste generated from the clean should be dealt with in the same manner as described above by double bagging as Category B infectious waste.</p>

    <h3>Decontaminations</h3>

    <p>In the event that there is a confirmed case of Covid-19 you are likely to have to conduct a decontamination.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Should a third-party contractor be used, it is their responsibility to appropriately manage and dispose of any waste arising from the decontamination.</li>
      <li>Should the decontamination be conducted by in-house employees, please follow the same process as above (Dealing with the waste).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Exceptions</h3>

    <p>In confirmed cases where decontamination has yet to occur, and the driver/technician attends to collect waste, they may not enter the premises to obtain a signature on the statutory documentation for consignment. This is to ensure the risks to the employees are minimised as much as is possible</p>

    <h3>Further advice</h3>

    <p>Should further advice be needed on the management of Covid-19, please seek assistance from your designated Infection Control Practitioner or visit gov.uk. If your queries relate to the collection and disposal of clinical waste please contact Anenta Ltd on 0330122 2143 or email contact@anenta.com.</p>
